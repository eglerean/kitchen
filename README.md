# üçΩÔ∏è Welcome to the Terminal Kitchen!

You've entered a digital kitchen full of ingredients...
Which ingredients are still fresh? What can you cook with it?

Note! There's an ingredient that is myserious, almost (en)cryptic! If you want to check what it is you can use the command `unzip -l [filename]`.
To uncover the secret use password "kitchen2025"
